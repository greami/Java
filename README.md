Easy Servlet Java
Hi,
this is how i build a servelet in JAVAEE, i use NetBeans IDE e GlassFish for loal Server.
suggest:
-when the name of servlet path is case sentsitive even in the browser
-when we add a parameter for the servlet use: ?[parameter]
-when tou start tour project you can see "hello word", don't worry, this a default message if you
 want to change it you have to modify the file html in the web page directory
